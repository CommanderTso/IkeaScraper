IkeaScraper
==

A hacked-together scraper to pull products from Ikea.com
--

This is a heavily commented bit of scraping code I wrote that pulls most available products from Ikea.com and saves them out to CSVs.

The code could use all sorts of cleanup, and is mostly up as a quick tutorial on web scraping. It is left to the user to make sense of the Nokogiri syntax and string methods used.

To run:
- Clone down the repository
- `ruby test.rb`
